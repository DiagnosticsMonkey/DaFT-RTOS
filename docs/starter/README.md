# Starter Series

Welcome to the Starter Series, here we are going to link some materials to give you an understanding of the fundamentals of Real-Time Operating Systems.

RTOSes have existed for a long time, the fundamentals are a well trodden path.  
âˆ´ there is little value in writing new materials when great materials already exist, instead we'll cherry-pick and contextualise elements we feel are important.

## Topics

- [What is an RTOS](starter/what) - High-level overview of what an RTOS is and the different types of real-time.
- [Bare-metal vs RTOS?](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/lessons/lesson-7-multithreaded-applications/topic/bare-metal-vs-rtos-programming/) - Nordic Semi have created a terse overview - You can also complete the full course, for free, and obtain a certificate..
