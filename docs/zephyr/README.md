# Zephyr

Welcome to the Zephyr Series, here we are going to go through some of the fundamentals of Zephyr. Either teaching you something new, or refreshing you on what you may have otherwise forgotten!

We need to cover off some of these as a pre-requisite to make sure everyone is working from a common baseline, before we go off-piste.

## Topics

- [What is Zephyr?](zephyr/what)
- [What is DeviceTree?](zephyr/devicetree)
- [What is KConfig?](zephyr/kconfig)
