# DaFT : RTOS

So, you've decided to explore the world of Real-Time Operating Systems!  

> [!WARNING]
> The content here is still being built up. Here be dragons!
>
> In its current form, it is intended to be run through Ad-Hoc as a group with a lot of context and explainers added verbally.

> Exercises will also be determined on the day based on the group and the respective level they're working at, tailored to each user.

## What does this cover?

The over-arching aim of this course is similar to that of [DaFT : C for Sparkplugs](https://diagnosticsmonkey.github.io/DaFT-C4Sparkplugs) - to build you up to be confident at tackling problems that require you to either modify someone elses code or to write your own thing from scratch.  
We'll cover key concepts, benefits, downsides, and specific examples of setting up and using an RTOS.

The content is split into a couple of pillars ->

1. [Starter Series](starter/) -> Start here if you don't know what an RTOS _is_,
2. [Zephyr targetted information](zephyr/) -> Start here if you want to dive in to Zephyr.

## Tools

We will eventually be using a handful of development kits with this material. Ultimately the course could be run on any of them, but you should try to pick up some kits from multiple vendors so that you can compare the difference between them.

In the first instance, we'll focus on Nordic Semiconductor.
