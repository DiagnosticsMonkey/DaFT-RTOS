# DaFT : RTOS

So, you've decided to explore the world of Real-Time Operating Systems!  

> [!WARNING]
> The content here is still being built up. Here be dragons!

## What does this cover?

The over-arching aim of this course is similar to that of [DaFT : C for Sparkplugs](https://diagnosticsmonkey.github.io/DaFT-C4Sparkplugs) - to build you up to be confident at tackling problems that require you to either modify someone elses code or to write your own thing from scratch.  
We'll cover key concepts, benefits, downsides, and specific examples of setting up and using an RTOS.

The content is split into a couple of pillars ->

1. [Starter Series](starter/) -> Start here if you don't know what an RTOS _is_,
2. [Zephyr targetted information](zephyr/) -> Start here if you want to dive in to Zephyr.

## Tools

We will be using a handful of development kits with this material. Ultimately the course could be run on any of them, but if you can try to at least pick up some kits from multiple vendors at least so that you can compare the difference between them.
